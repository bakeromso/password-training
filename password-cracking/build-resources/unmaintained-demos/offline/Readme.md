# Offline hash cracking
This demo uses John the Ripper and oclHashCat to do brute force attacks on different types of password hashes. John the Ripper uses a regular CPU to carry out the brute force attack where oclHashCat utilizes any available GPUs as well. (John the Ripper can also be built with GPU support, but by default it is not.)

## Demo locations
All the demos for offline hash cracking are located under `/root/password-cracking/offline` in de docker image.

# Benchmarks
Both John the Ripper and HashCat come with a built-in benchmark feature which allows you to test the number of hashes per second it will be able to do on the current system. By default these benchmarks test all available hash types. Note that you are not required to run these benchmarks to use the demos. They are only to get an indication of the cracking speed you may expect on the specific hardware you are using, as well as validating that the tools work correctly. If hashcat gives you an error like this: `clGetDeviceIDs() : -1 : CL_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND` you don't have the hardware and/or runtime required to run hashcat. See the **Hashcat** section for more information on this.

Benchmarks for John the ripper:
```
john --test
```

Benchmarks for oclHashCat:
```
hashcat -b
```

# John the Ripper
## Cracking hashes with John the Ripper
John expects a file with password hashes which may be either a single hash on each line or a **username:hash** combination on each line. The exact format for the hash depends on the type of hash being cracked. In many cases john can figure out the type of hash automatically but you can also specify the type of hash with the **--format** parameter. Running john without any arguments shows the help, which lists all available hash types and character sets.

John will use 'incremental' mode by default. This is basically the 'brute force' mode where it tries all possible character combinations. You can specify this mode, and the character set you want by using the **--incremental** flag. The other common option is to specify a list of passwords to try with the **--wordlist** option. There is a third option which can be very useful when trying a long list of hashes which have additional account information associated with it, this is the **--single** option. It will try a small set of passwords based on the information associated with the account. For example the username being used as the password etc. This can be a very quick way of looking for weak passwords in a long list of accounts.

Example of doing a brute force attack on an md5crypt hash with letters only.

```
john --format=md5crypt --incremental=alpha hashes_john_1.txt
```

Example of hashes_john_1.txt line using a format commonly found on Unix-like systems. Additional account information may be placed behind the hash using more : separators.
```
username:$1$uOM6WNc4$r3ZGeSB11q6UUSILqek3J1
^         ^ ^        ^
|         | |        |
|         | |        `- Start of hash
|         | `- Salt
|         `- Hash type (type 1 is FreeBSD MD5)
`- Accounts' corresponding username (optional)
```

In the "offline" directory you can find files `hashes_john_1.txt` and `hashes_john_2.txt`, containing an augmented format salted md5 and sha-512 hash, respectively. Both should result in the plaintext password "hash234". Additionally there is a Windows LM and NTLM hash available for the same password. These hashes can be found in the files `hashes_lm.txt` and `hashes_ntlm.txt`. 

### Speeding up cracking

There are a few very simple ways we can optimize john to crack passwords faster in any mode we happen to be using.
 - More hashes in a file:   If you have many hashes to crack, putting them all in the same file and allowing john to manage them will enable it to carry out the costly hashing function only once and try the hash against all hashes in the list. If different salts are used for every hash, this will not help.
 - The **--fork** option:   By default john will only run on one CPU core. To take full advantage of multi core machines you can use --fork=8 to spawn 8 instances of john which will divide the work up between them. Since john is almost entirely CPU bound, setting --fork to the number of cores in the system is usually a good bet. John automatically drops the priority of its cracking workload so it will not freeze up your system when running on all cores, but leaving one core free is a good idea if you want to do anything else on the system while the cracking process is running.

### John-jumbo

The default john comes with a 'stripped down' feature set which includes the things most commonly used, however there is a john-jumbo package which contains extra options which can help with large cracking jobs. For example the ability to spread a cracking job across a large scale computer cluster using the OpenMPI framework and the ability to utilize GPU accelerators. John-jumbo also supports many additional hash types.

### Note about .pot files
John stores hash cracking progress in a .pot file. By default this file is located here `~/.john/john.pot`. If you wish to re-crack a hash you must remove this file or specify an alternate potfile using the **--pot=POTFILE** option. If you wish to show the current status for cracked hashes, call john with the --show option and the hash file.
```
john --show hashes_john_1.txt
```

### Sessions
If you want your cracking session to be saved, you can use the **--session=NAME** option. John will store it's current status and progress in the file you specify there. When your cracking session is interrupted you can pick up where you left of at a later time using the **--restore=NAME** option.

# Hashcat
Before the release of Hashcat version 3 there were two versions of Hashcat; Hashcat and oclHashcat. The main difference was that oclHashcat was built with CUDA/OpenCL support and hashcat was not. Since Hashcat v3 this distinction no longer exists and the only Hashcat build available has full support for all algorithms and OpenCL runtimes, including support for some more exotic OpenCL capable accelerators other than GPUs, such as Co-processors and FPGAs. 

Take note that since hashcat version 3.00, you **MUST** have an OpenCL runtime and OpenCL compatible device. If you do not have such a device you cannot run hashcat at all. If you do have an OpenCL capable device and you want to run hashcat inside your docker container you must expose it to your docker container using the `--device /dev/device` parameter when starting it. The exact device name and parameters depend on the make and model of your OpenCL capable device as well as the operating system and driver you are using. You will have to install the OpenCL runtime libraries for your OpenCL device inside your docker container too.

## Cracking hashes with Hashcat
Hashcat does not support the augmented hash file format. The hashes file must be a single hash on a line by itself. You must usually tell hashcat what type of hash you are cracking by using the **-m** option, otherwise **-m 0** is assumed. You must tell hashcat what type of attack you want to do by specifying the **-a** option. If omitted hashcat assumes you want to do a dictionary attack. Calling hashcat with the --help option will list all available hash types and attack modes.

This time the hashes_hashcat_1.txt file will only contain *$1$uOM6WNc4$r3ZGeSB11q6UUSILqek3J1*. The **-m 500** option specifies we want to use hash type 500, which is md5crypt again.
```
hashcat -m 500 hashes_hashcat_1.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

When doing a brute force attack we must specify this attack type with the option **-a 3**, however this is not all we need to specify for the brute force attack. We also need to specify a password generator. The generator specification follows a specific format. For each character of the password to generate you need a **?** followed by one or more charset specifiers. This can be **u** for uppercase characters, **l** for lowercase, **d** for digits etc. You can find the complete list of available charsets in the hashcat --help output. So for example if we want to crack passwords of 4 characters long, only lowercase the generator string would be **?l?l?l?l**. If we wanted to do the same but include uppercase too it will become **?ul?ul?ul?ul**. However note that this will only generate passwords EXACTLY 4 characters long. If we also want hashcat to generate the combinations of 1-3 characters long we must pass it the **--increment** option too.

Example of a brute force command where we look for passwords 1-8 characters long, starting with 4 lowercase letters, followed by 4 numbers.
```
hashcat -m 500 -a 3 hashes_hashcat_1.txt ?l?l?l?l?d?d?d?d --increment
```

### Note about .pot files
Hashcat also makes use of a .pot file to store previously cracked passwords. It is located here `~/.hashcat/hashcat.pot`. If you want to crack a hash again, you will need to remove it from the pot file, disable potfiles using the **--potfile-disable** option or specify an alternate potfile with the **--potfile-path** option. To display cracked hashes from the .pot file you need to use the **--show** option in hashcat. Note that you need to specify the hash type in order for the lookup to succeed.

Examples;
```
hashcat -m 500 --show hashes_hashcat_1.txt
hashcat -m 3000 --show hashes_lm.txt
```

### Sessions
Hashcat also supports saving your current cracking state in a session. When you start hashcat with the **--session=name** parameter specified, you can resume your session at a later time by calling hashcat again with the **--resume** parameter.


# When to use John and when to use Hashcat?
This usually depends on the infrastructure you have available to perform password cracking on and the type of attack you want to perform. Hashcat is highly optimized for fast hashing and will usually generate more hashes per second than john, but it lacks much of the customization options in brute force generators and mutators and doesn't have the level of session management that john does. For running a distributed cracking job, john is a little more mature at this time, of course this may change in the future. Both hashcat and john are capable of supporting GPU accelerators, but hashcat has had a lot of time and effort put into optimization of the algorithms, which is part of the reason why hashcat lays claim to the title of "Worlds fastest password cracker".
In short, if you have a single machine to run your cracking task and you are using a wordlist or a simple brute force generator, hashcat is likely the faster option, especially if you have a CUDA or OpenCL capable GPU. For more complex rules or larger distributed systems, john is probably the better option.
