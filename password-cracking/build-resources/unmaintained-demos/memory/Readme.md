```

A dumpfile will be created. Paste it inside the Folder:

Now use Volatility to check for the hivelist
```
python vol.py -f IE8WIN7-20160923-152024.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86 hivelist
```

Now that we see the list. Use the virtual address from the Entry with the name '\SystemRoot\System32\Config\SAM'.
(This is the file where Windows stores the user passwords)
```
python vol.py -f IE8WIN7-20160923-152024.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86 hashdump -s 0x9515f598 >
